Communicate Data Findings 

Project 5 - Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

The Dataset chosen for this project is the FordGoBike System Dataset. This is the Bay Area’s bikeshare system. With thousands of bikes available, it’s the most fun, convenient, and affordable way to explore the region.

 

Data analysis is important in business to understand problems facing an organisation, and to explore data in meaningful ways. Data in itself is merely facts and figures. Data analysis organises, interprets, structures and presents the data into useful information that provides context for the data.

Data visualization refers to presenting data in a graphical or pictorial form, such as a pie chart. This allows audiences to recognize patterns more quickly. Interactive visualizations allow decision-makers to drill down through the layers of detail. This changes perspectives so that users can review the facts behind the analys

There are two main reasons for creating visuals using data:

Exploratory analysis is done when you are searching for insights. These visualizations don't need to be perfect. You are using plots to find insights, but they don't need to be aesthetically appealing. You are the consumer of these plots, and you need to be able to find the answer to your questions from these plots.

Explanatory analysis is done when you are providing your results for others. These visualizations need to provide you the emphasis necessary to convey your message. They should be accurate, insightful, and visually appealing.

4)	Communicating the Story

Main Findings from the Analysis:

This bike share system has greatly identified the need of the times and created a business that is profitable to both the end customers and the business. It is definitely a win-win solution. 
1)	 Between the User types, Customers and Subscribers the highest usage in terms of duration was by Customers in the year 2019
2)	Majority of the system’s bookings came through their app bookings – Lyft
3)	The station that received the highest demand in the year 2019 was the station 58 which as the Market St at 10th Street. However, after cleaning the data and removing all the bookings that were made through non-traditional booking methods which is app and dipper, the station with the highest demand was the station 296, which is 5th St at Virginia Street.
4)	The Station 296, the highest demand was on Tuesdays followed by Thursdays. The least demand was on Sundays.
5)	The User type who used this station the most were the Subscribers

Submitted Files:

1)	A report with your exploratory data analysis, in PDF or HTML format. If you used a Jupyter Notebook to conduct your analysis, you should also include the original .ipynb file in your submission. If you did not, you should include the code you used in your exploration as .pyscripts.
2)	A slide deck presentation with your explanatory analysis, in PDF or HTML format. If you used a Jupyter Notebook, include the original .ipynb file with your submission and any template file used to render the slide deck.
3)	A readme document, in plain text, Markdown, or PDF format, including the following information:
4)	Which dataset you chose. If not part of Udacity's dataset options, document the source of your data.
5)	Main findings from the exploratory data analysis, and how you chose the results to put in your explanatory analysis.
6)	If you obtained feedback from others for your explanatory designs, document them here.
7)	List of resources used during the creation of the project. This includes web sites, books, forums, blog posts, and GitHub repositories.
